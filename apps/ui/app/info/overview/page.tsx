                    ReMeLife provides support to those struggling with daily life, whether with care, or cognitive or

                    family connectivity, activity, social engagement, and care management. A better quality of life for
                    everyone!

                    Critically, ReMeLife collects the knowledge of the person through digital care activities. It then
                    uses this data to improve their engagement with those in their care circles. Additionally, the data
                    will foster an increase in their ability to use today's technology.

                  <p>
                    What's more, ReMeLife members earn REME tokens as rewards for their daily care actions, content
                    sharing, and therapy. These are redeemable for discounted products and services in the ReMeLife
                    Market.
