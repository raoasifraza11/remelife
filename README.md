# ReMeLife Website - Console Error Fixes

This document outlines the fixes applied to resolve various console errors and warnings that were causing excessive re-rendering and performance issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Motion.js Deprecation Warning
**Problem**: `motion()` is deprecated. Use `motion.create()` instead.
**Solution**: Updated all instances of `motion(Image)` to `motion.create(Image)` in:
- `app/page.tsx`
- `components/header.tsx`
- `app/register/page.tsx`
- `app/rewards/page.tsx`
- `components/sections/digital-care-toolkit-section.tsx`
- `app/page-backup.tsx`

### 2. Viewport Metadata Warning
**Problem**: Unsupported metadata viewport is configured in metadata export. Please move it to viewport export instead.
**Solution**: 
- Removed `viewport` from `metadata` export in `app/layout.tsx`
- Added separate `viewport` export with proper configuration

### 3. Framer Motion Animation Errors
**Problem**: Trying to animate color from "inherit" to specific colors. "inherit" is not an animatable value.
**Solution**: Replaced `"inherit"` with `"currentColor"` in `components/header.tsx` color animations.

### 4. Font Loading 404 Errors
**Problem**: Satoshi font files were returning 404 errors as they don't exist in the `/fonts/` directory.
**Solution**: Updated `app/globals.css` to use system fonts as fallbacks instead of trying to load non-existent local font files.

### 5. Favicon 404 Errors
**Problem**: Manifest and layout files were referencing `.png` files that don't exist, while `.webp` files are available.
**Solution**: 
- Updated `public/manifest.json` to use `.webp` file extensions
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` to use `.webp` file extensions
- All favicon references now point to existing files

### 6. Excessive Re-rendering
**Problem**: Fast Refresh was rebuilding constantly, indicating performance issues.
**Solution**: 
- Added `React.memo` wrapper to `RootLayout` component
- Used `React.useMemo` to memoize head content
- These optimizations prevent unnecessary re-renders during development

## Performance Improvements

- **Reduced Re-renders**: Memoized components and values to prevent unnecessary updates
- **Fixed Resource Loading**: All favicon and font resources now load correctly
- **Updated Dependencies**: Used latest Framer Motion API to avoid deprecation warnings
- **Optimized Metadata**: Proper Next.js 15 viewport configuration

## Files Modified

- `app/layout.tsx` - Viewport export, favicon updates, performance optimizations
- `app/globals.css` - Font fallback system
- `components/header.tsx` - Motion API update, color animation fix
- `app/page.tsx` - Motion API update
